DESCRIPTION:The Summit Church has a vision to plant 1000 churches by 2050. 
 This is an audacious goal that will require at least 1000 guitar players an
 d worship leaders. To help meet this need\, Scott Swanek will be presenting
  the “Wing Man – Electric Guitar for Worship” seminar to inspire and equip 
 willing students to enhance the musical worship experience. This course is 
 designed to move the “first position playing” acoustic or electric guitaris
 t to using the entire fretboard of an acoustic or electric guitar to suppor
 t and enhance the worship experience.\nStudents will have to have good abil
 ity and knowledge with basic “open” chord forms. Past attendees ages have r
 anged from 18 to 58. Seminar graduates may go on to serve on a worship team
  or influence others who will!

DESCRIPTION:\nRSVP for any/all of the Gospel-Centered Marriage seminars HER
 E.\n\nWhy do so many marriages that begin with sincere love and the best in
 tentions end in divorce? Why do so many marriages that start with great pro
 mise and greater dreams end up just staying together “for the kids” and “li
 ving as roommates”? These are disturbingly relevant questions regardless of
  where we are in our marital journey (i.e.\, dating\, engaged\, newlywed\, 
 or celebrating an anniversary).\nWhatever the answer is\, Christians are no
 t immune to “it.” The divorce rate among Christian couples is equivalent to
  the rest of the culture. If the statistics are true\, then much of what we
 \, as Christians\, are doing to correct the problem is ineffective\, misgui
 ded\, or possibly even feeding the problem.\nWhat does it take to make marr
 iage work? How does our marriage enrichment not degenerate into a series of
  random acts of kindness driven or distracted by the tyranny of the urgent?
  How do we ensure that our individual acts of marital enrichment are workin
 g together to build a momentum and gather energy from one another?\nThese a
 re important questions to ask\, even if you are not currently discouraged o
 r overwhelmed by the number of seemingly unrelated things that need to be d
 one to improve your marriage. Marital enrichment that feels random is hard 
 to maintain\, easily forgotten\, and tends to get bumped down the priority 
 chain. This is why we must not allow marital enrichment to remain random.\n
 What are the essential things a couple should focus on in order to have a m
 arriage that flourishes? What is a covenant\, and why is marriage a covenan
 t? Why do we have a marriage ceremony? What are the roles for a Christian h
 usband and wife? What if I don’t “fit” the masculine-feminine stereotypes o
 r don’t have the personality to match a “traditional” husband/wife?\nPlease
  note: We are unable to offer child care during the Intensive Seminars.

DESCRIPTION:\nRSVP for any/all of the Gospel-Centered Marriage seminars HER
 E.\n\nWhat does a couple talk about over a life time? What if I’m not good 
 with words or listening? How do we maintain friendship when we’re having to
  keep up with so many logistics? How do we disagree and protect our marriag
 e without losing what’s important to each of us individually? Why do words 
 matter so much\, and why can they hurt so badly? How do we make things righ
 t after they go wrong and not let negative momentum build?\nThis seminar is
  one piece of a five part series of seminars designed to facilitate mentori
 ng relationships for married or engaged couples (one-on-one or in a group s
 etting). Our goal in these seminars is to cover the key subjects that often
  hinder\, but could greatly enhance\, a couple’s ability to experience all 
 that God intended marriage to be.\nWe believe that change that lasts happen
 s in relationship. Private change tends to be short-lived change. Living th
 ings exposed to light grow. Living things kept in the dark wither. This is 
 why we designed this series to encourage you to give your marriage the ligh
 t of Christian community by studying these materials with others.\nThese ma
 terials are built upon a central premise – God gave us marriage so that we 
 would know the gospel more clearly and more personally. It is the gospel th
 at gives us joy. Marriage is the meant to be a living picture of the gospel
 -relationship between God and His bride\, the church.\nFor this reason\, we
  have two goals for you as you go through this study:\n1. That you would ge
 t know and enjoy your spouse in exciting\, new\, and profoundly deeper ways
 \, so that…\n2. … you would get to know and enjoy God in exciting\, new\, a
 nd profoundly deeper ways.\nThis series of seminars is arranged around five
  topics that represent the most common challenges that face a marriage. Whi
 le the challenges of each area are acknowledged\, the tone of these seminar
 s is optimistic. We believe that the that those things that cause the great
 est pain when done wrongly bring the fullest joy when done according to God
 ’s design.\nPlease note: We are unable to offer child care during the Inten
 sive Seminars.

 E.\n\nHave you ever asked yourself any of these questions:\n\nWhy are money
  problems the number one cause of divorce? How do we maintain reasonable ex
 pectations for money in a debt-sick culture? How do two people manage their
  money together when it is hard enough to manage as a single person? Who sh
 ould administrate the finances and how involved should the other person be?
  How do we learn self-control and contentment as a couple? How can “budget”
  become an exciting or\, at least\, pleasant word?\n\nImagine you’re on the
  Family Feud game show. The host comes to you and says\, “We’ve surveyed 10
 0 families and asked what they believe is a good idea\, but still don’t do.
  Can you give us one of the top five answers?” There is a good chance if yo
 u answered\, “Budgeting\,” you would have the #1 answer.\nThere is no one w
 ho really believes\, “You can neglect paying attention to your finances and
  expect everything to turn out fine. Spend what you want\, when you want\, 
 try not to be excessive (but don’t define “excessive”)\, and you should be 
 alright.” We would roll our eyes and laugh as we read this if it were not t
 he reality in which so many people tried to live.\nIf want to gain the tool
 s and process to (1) correct ineffective thinking about money\, (2) create 
 a budget that you can administrate in less than 30 minutes per week\, (3) l
 earn how to communicate about financial decisions\, (4) get out of debt\, a
 nd (5) utilize your finances to shape your life to be more like Christ\, th
 en this event is for you.\nPlease note: We are unable to offer child care d

DESCRIPTION:\nRSVP for any/all of the Gospel-Centered Marriage seminars HER
 E.\nHow do we manage our time? How do we navigate situations where we each 
 want good things that cannot both happen? How do we determine God’s will fo
 r our personal and marital lives? How do we functionally express the biblic
 al roles of headship and submission? How do we ensure that life’s tough dec
 isions draw us closer to God and each other instead of creating distance? H
 ow do we respond when bad things happen to a good marriage or our plans?\nT
 rying to learn how to make decisions\, as an individual or as a couple\, ca
 n feel a bit like trying to learn how to breathe. It seems like something t
 hat has to be natural in order to be effective. If we had to think about br
 eathing\, then we’d fear getting distracted and suffocating. When we think 
 about being intentional in our decision making it can quickly feel like suc
 h an effort would take over our lives.\nThere is good deal of merit to this
  concern. If we tried to bring overt thought and prescribe processes to eve
 ry individual or marital decision in order to ensure that we arrived at the
  will of God\, then our lives would be paralyzed. We would live in fear or 
 fail to completed a large number of tasks that life requires.\nBut we’ve al
 l been burned by the alternative. After a bad decision we put on our “20/20
  Hindsight Glasses” and see how greater intentionality could have alleviate
 d the unpleasant outcome. We begin to think it would be “worth it” to run o
 ur decisions through some kind of process. But it’s hard to determine what 
 level of decision warrants this process (where’s “the line”?) and what kind
  of process to use for each decision.\nThese challenges emerge before we in
 troduce the difficulty of two-party decision making required in marriage. I
 t is hard enough to answer these questions as an individual\, but they are 
 multiplied when married couples must both agree (mental consent) and cooper
 ate (logistical follow through) on decisions.\nThese are the challenges we 
 are tackling in this seminar. In order to address these challenges\, we wil
 l divide decision making into three arenas. Too often\, couples try to forc
 e all decision making to fit into one or two of these arenas. They may do t
 his for convenience (but simple becomes simplistic) or conviction (emphasiz
 ing some part of what Scripture teaches to the neglect of other parts).\n\n
 \nPersonal Decision Making (Disciple): The foundation of a healthy couple i
 s two individuals committed to wise personal decision making. We must be a 
 faithful disciple of Christ before we will be a good husband/wife to our sp
 ouse. It is neither possible nor advisable for a couple to consult each oth
 er on every decision they make. Shared values\, agreed upon life structures
  (i.e.\, calendar and budget)\, and appreciation for what is important to e
 ach other comprise the foundation of personal decision making that will ble
 ss a marriage. We will discuss how to approach personal decision making in 
 chapters two and three.\n\nConsensus Decision Making (Friends): Another lar
 ge portion of marital decisions will be made as friends through the process
  of consensus. This is how two individuals begin to shape “our life” togeth
 er that represents the new “we” more than the individual “me’s.” As a coupl
 e grows in their knowledge and sacrifice for another\, this arena of decisi
 on making should become an increasingly larger percentage of their shared d
 ecision making. Consensus should be the default approach to decision making
  throughout      marriage. How to approach consensus decision making will b
 e discussed in chapter four.\n\nCorporate Decision Making (Headship-Submiss
 ion): Not all decisions can be made through consensus. Couples will not agr
 ee on every decision. Some decisions do not allow for a “middle ground” bec
 ause of limited options. How and when to engage the headship-submission sty
 le of decision making will be discussed in chapter five. But a brief prefac
 e will be made here. The fact that God gives husbands the role of headship 
 in these kinds of decisions does not mean the husband must/should choose hi
 s preference in each instance. While the final call does belong to the husb
 and\, it is a poor husband who always calls his own number.\n\nPlease note:
  We are unable to offer child care during the Intensive Seminars.

 E.\n\nWhat are we going to talk about in this seminar? Sex… romance… affect
 ion… affirming words… weekly date nights… talking about our feelings… vulne
 rability… What is “intimacy”?\nChances are you won’t create something you c
 an’t define and many couples have a hard time agreeing about what counts as
  intimacy. “Agreeing to disagree” is definitely not the solution to this di
 lemma.\nFor this seminar “intimacy” will be used to capture the full breadt
 h of romantic activities shared by husband and wife\; from encouragement\, 
 flirting\, serving\, and handholding to romantic get aways\, long love lett
 ers\, and gourmet sex. This seminar is about maintaining a deep sense of en
 joyment for each other.\nIt is easy to allow the awkwardness of this subjec
 t – talking about emotions\, affection\, and sex – to prevent a couple from
  enjoying some of marriage’s sweetest fruit. It takes a mature man and woma
 n to flirt tastefully over a lifetime\, put their dreams and desires into w
 ords consistently\, and talk wholesomely about what is sexually enjoyable.\
 nMost of these are conversations you should not be having with anyone else\
 , so it makes sense there would be some awkwardness. Don’t allow the potent
 ial clumsiness of speech or action to prevent you from pursuing and enjoyin
 g the spouse God has blessed you with.\nPlease note: We are unable to offer
  child care during the Intensive Seminars.\n

DESCRIPTION:Once a semester we gather all of our MS Students (5th-8th grade
 ) from every campus for a night of fellowship\, worship\, and proclaiming t
 he Gospel. It’s a perfect opportunity for your students to invite their unc
 hurched and unsaved friends. This year we will be combining this event with
  Elevate United\, our all campus worship gathering for our High School Stud
 ents. This is one of the few times that all students from all campuses will
  be in the same room.  Jordan Daniels (BRC) will be leading our students in
  worship while Special Guest and Clayton King will be proclaiming the Gospe
 l.\nHere are a few details specifically for the Cary Campus with some immed
 iate action steps. \nWe need parents to give rides to ensure that we can ge
 t all of our students to Elevate. We are going to try using a group carpool
  website to coordinate these rides and will plan to arrive at Cary High Sch
 ool at 3:45 and leave for Brier Creek at 3:50. You can add your car\, and s
 ign your student up for rides here. \nWe also need parents to help voluntee
 r. We’re having a carnival style fellowship time before the service starts 
 and need parent’s help to run games and serve food. You can bring your stud
 ent\, serve at Elevate\, and then stay for the service to see what a night 
 in Student Ministry is really like. This is a great way to get a look behin
 d the scenes in Student Ministry. This also will enable our small group lea
 ders to focus their time at Elevate on investing in your students\, rather 
 than volunteering. If you can serve\, please let us know here. \nThis is go
 ing to be a landmark event for our student ministry and I don’t want your s
 tudents to miss out. Make plans today to join us.

 ry philosophy and skills within the context of adult learning styles and re
 lationships. We will come together once a month to discuss topics such as e
 vangelism as a way of life and how to help someone grow in their faith. The

 discuss together as well as opportunities to prepare and present a passage.
  When was the last time you had a personal and spiritual development plan? 
 How would you help to develop one with your disciples? The skills you devel
 op in this Cohort will be practical and transferable.  At the end of this y
 ear I believe you will be a more effective disciple maker than ever before.

DESCRIPTION:\nRSVP Here\n\nWe don’t just consume food. We have a relationsh
 ip with food. From infancy\, bad behavior was punished with “no dessert for
  you” and if we worked extra hard we “deserved a treat.”\nNow we feel guilt
 y for eating “bad foods” (by whatever criteria we moralize food) and we are
  perpetually self-conscious about our figure (as if there was a “holy” body
  type which receives God’s special favor).\nHopefully\, you can begin to se
 e that food is so much more than fuel in our culture. For many of us\, a pr
 imary obstacle to a healthy relationship with God is an unhealthy relations
 hip with food. We “cast our cares” on comfort foods instead of the God of a
 ll comfort\, and we live with a sense of guilt or anxiety over our eating h
 abits.\nGaining a Healthy Relationship with Food is a seminar intended to c
 ounter this strong cultural tendency. This seminar addresses both over-indu
 lgence and/or over-restriction in your relationship with food. Both over-ea
 ting and anorexia or bulimia result from asking food to do more than food c
 an do.\nBoth sides of the unhealthy relationship with food spectrum will be
  addressed. We will acknowledge the unique facets of each struggle\, but po
 int to the same answer: the freedom of Christ which allows you to accept th
 e body God gave you as good\, while wisely stewarding your body for God’s g
 lory and your satisfaction.

DESCRIPTION:This team will be traveling to Bolivia to encourage long term S
 ummit workers there and to aid them and their partners in ministering to un
 reached people.  The team will be helping lead and support a retreat which 
 will bring in local missionaries from 14 different tribes for training\, en
 couragement\, and renewal.  Many of these missionaries work with other unre
 ached tribes.  They are an overworked\, under-served group working out of l
 ove for God and in survival mode. We are passionate about offering a nurtur
 ing\, caring atmosphere for them\, where they can also receive some trainin
 g that will aid them in their work.  The opportunities to help advance the 
 Gospel are many and team members of various skills and passions are needed.
